Password cracking is the process of using an application program to identify an unknown or forgotten password to a
computer or network resource. It can also be used to help a threat actor obtain unauthorized access to resources.

With the information malicious actors gain using password cracking, they can undertake a range of criminal
activities. Those include stealing banking credentials or using the information for identity theft and fraud.

A password cracker recovers passwords using various techniques. The process can involve comparing a list of
words to guess passwords or the use of an algorithm to repeatedly guess the password.
